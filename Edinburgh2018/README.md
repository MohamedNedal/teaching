# National STFC CDT for Data-intensive Science Welcome Event
## Held in Edinburgh, Scotland, 19-21 Nov. 2018

At this event, I hosted a tutorial on classical unsupervised learning techniques using `scikit-learn`. In the `Exercises.ipynb` notebook provided, there is a tutorial on using principle component analysis (PCA) for both dimensionality reduction and clustering as well as hierachical clustering with the opportunity to use different linkages and metrics to see how this affects clustering.

These examples perform these techniques on an artificial dataset with a certain number of clusters pre-defined to illustrate the powerful usage of these methods and how the computer is well-versed at these unsupervised tasks (given some supervised initialisation).
